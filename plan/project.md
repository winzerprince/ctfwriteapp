## Tech Stack
- Node.js(backend)
- React(frontend)
- JSON data storage(as small db)

### Functional Requirements
- Userauth via username and password
- View list of previously created markdown
- Create new markdown entry via a form
- Generate md from form inputs
- Upload md to specific git repo

### Non-functional Requirements
- Localhost-only deployment
- Cross-platform compatibility(linux, windows)
- Secure handling of github token and user credentials
- Modular codebase for extensibility
- Can run offline
- Executable build with minimal external dependencies
